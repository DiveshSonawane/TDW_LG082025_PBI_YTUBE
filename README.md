Repository for TopDataWorks Project which contains files, dashboards and documentation related to Power BI Analysis.

# 📊 YouTube Analytics Dashboard  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project is part of my **Power BI Internship at TopDataWorks**.  
The goal was to build an **interactive YouTube Analytics Dashboard** that provides insights into channel and video performance across Indian languages.  

The dashboard delivers:  
- 📈 Total Views, Subscribers, and Channels  
- 🌍 Language-wise distribution of views and subscribers  
- ⏱️ Video performance by size (Short / Medium / Long)  
- 🔎 Efficiency metrics such as *Views per Subscriber* and *Views per Minute*  
- 🏆 Top Channels by subscribers and engagement  
- 📊 Storytelling visuals: KPI cards, bar charts, pie charts, treemaps, line charts, bubble charts, and drill-down tables

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies  

- **Power BI Desktop** – for data visualization & dashboarding  
- **Power Query** – for ETL (data cleaning & transformation)  
- **DAX** – for calculated measures and KPIs  
- **GitHub** – for version control & documentation

## 📊 Key Measures Created  

- **Views per Subscriber** = Total Views ÷ Total Subscribers  
- **Avg Video Duration (Min)** = AVERAGE(duration_sec) ÷ 60  
- **Views per Minute** = Total Views ÷ Total Minutes  
- **Views Share %** = Context Views ÷ Total Views
